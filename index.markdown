# Ray-Net Whitepaper 0.0.1
Ray-Net is a "FOSS" lateral humanity wide network (under development, and looing for funding), a new Internet where we respect the rights of the digital world before we use it for our own benefit, to avoid a "digital global warming"! The internet is built on the following principles:-
1. Privacy is inefficient. Ray-Net doesn't force Privacy, you get it when convenient, and you don't when efficient.
2. Digital Transactions are the only form of Privacy left. Everything from accounts and data-packet transfers to monetary value transfers and exchange should all be completely anonymous.
3. Decentralization takes everything that is wrong with democracy and puts it on the internet, it is far better to use a network that has small centralized hives with a reputation rank, which is more efficient.
4. Everything should be peer-to-peer. A very efficient technology which has existed for decades but still not utilized everywhere, Ray-net is completely peer-to-peer centered.
5. The deeper the module the more stable it needs to be.
6. The shallow modules should be given free reign.
7. Everything should be platform and OS independent!
8. Digital Identities should be anonymous, disposable, and long-term focused. You have no business on the internet if you can't memorize a password.
9. The new internet should be first and foremost a information trading medium.
10. All networking should be stable over all networks, regardless of the health of that network.
11. The Internet should be extremely modular.
12. The Output of a program should be pipeable to the input of another program.
13. The development of Ray-Net should be easy enough to be adapted by programmers of all levels.
14. There are not websites, clouds, email clients, etc. Only other people's computers.
15. The initial purpose of developement of Ray-Net is to provide a computer network for free education, finincial technology, and social networking.

## The Chat Application
A Chat Application for Ray-Net is under development. It utilizes the `PGP` and `Web-of-Trust` protocols, and the additional `dead-drop protocol`, and the `ambassador protocol` to keep the messages safe, and the users anonymous. All communication is end-to-end encrypted!

### PGP
The PGP protocol uses AES (or ChaCha20 which is better for light-weight devices) of Symmetric Encryption, and instead of Generating Random Keys you decide on a key everytime you encrypt a message.

> Since computers can't generate true random numbers its up to you to do this yourself using dice or just guessing! Generating psudo-random numbers with a computer will make your encryption valunerable.

### Dead-Drop Protocol
In the Dead-Drop Protocol the priority is givin to getting the message to from Party-A to Party-B, without them ever comming in `face-2-face` contact.

> Note: `face-2-fact` contact here means having the knowledge of real world credentials as a requirement of meeting.

### Ambassador Protocol
In the Ambassador protocol we carry the message from one tower to the next, changing the name of the owner of the message. Going over several Towers allows circumventing several limitations and gives a certain degree of anonymity. This somewhat overcomes the indirect trust problem in a web-of-trust.
