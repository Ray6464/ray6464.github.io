# Ray-Net Whitepaper 0.0.1
Ray-Net is a "FOSS" lateral humanity wide network (under development, and looing for funding), a new Internet where we respect the rights of the digital world before we use it for our own benefit, to avoid a "digital global warming"! The internet is built on the following principles:-
1. Privacy is inefficient. Ray-Net doesn't force Privacy, you get it when convenient, and you don't when efficient.
2. Digital Transactions are the only form of Privacy left. Everything from accounts and data-packet transfers to monetary value transfers and exchange should all be completely anonymous.
3. Decentralization takes everything that is wrong with democracy and puts it on the internet, it is far better to use a network that has small centralized hives with a reputation rank, which is more efficient.
4. Everything should be peer-to-peer. A very efficient technology which has existed for decades but still not utilized everywhere, Ray-net is completely peer-to-peer centered.
5. The deeper the module the more stable it needs to be.
6. The shallow modules should be given free reign.
7. Everything should be platform and OS independent!
8. Digital Identities should be anonymous, disposable, and long-term focused. You have no business on the internet if you can't memorize a password.
9. The new internet should be first and foremost a information trading medium.
10. All networking should be stable over all networks, regardless of the health of that network.
11. The Internet should be extremely modular.
12. The Output of a program should be pipeable to the input of another program.
13. The development of Ray-Net should be easy enough to be adapted by programmers of all levels.
14. There are not websites, clouds, email clients, etc. Only other people's computers.
15. The initial purpose of developement of Ray-Net is to provide a computer network for free education, finincial technology, and social networking.
